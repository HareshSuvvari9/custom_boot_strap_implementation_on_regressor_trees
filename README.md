# Custom_boot_strap_implementation_on_regressor_trees

## Packages used:

1.numpy

2.sklearn

3.statistics

4.seaborn

5.matplotlib

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BOSTON dataset is used for implementation of custom boot strap model as In each sample: Consider any random 303(60% of 506) data points from whole data set and then replicate any 203 points from the sampled pointsÂ¶

sklearn's DecisionTreeRegressor is used as base model  and mean sqaure error and OOB score was observed for each sample 

graphs with respect to " (number of)samples_(number of)elements are plotted.

And central limit was observed and code with proper documentation is mentioned in the above ipython note book with proper documentation.

Use google colab or jupyter lab to access the notebook.
